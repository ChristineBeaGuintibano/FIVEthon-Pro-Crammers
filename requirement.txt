# What is the best library to use for this project?
- Tkinter. One of the most useful library in Python.

# Why we chose Tkinter as library for this project?
- Tkinter is lightweight and relatively painless to use compared to other frameworks. 
  This makes it a compelling choice for building GUI applications in Python, 
  especially for applications where a modern sheen is unnecessary, 
  and the top priority is to quickly build something thatâ€™s functional and cross-platform.

# Why is .gitignore important? 
- The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not tracked by git remain untracked.
  Say you run git add . from the root directory of your repo, and you have nothing ignored. 
  You've just added to the index all of those files you were mentally ignoring before.
  You can create a . gitignore file in your repository's root directory to tell Git which files and directories to ignore when you make a commit. 
  To share the ignore rules with other users who clone the repository, commit the . gitignore file in to your repository.

# Why is requirement.txt important?
  - The purpose of requirement.txt is to help prevent any conflict among the different projects.
    This can also serve as an easy tracker for your packages, it is usually located at the root directory of the project.
    It saves you a lot of time in maintaining the package dependencies in the given project.
  - When you start on developing, for example, your python application. You have to develop a specific version of the packages.
    And if you needed changes in your package maintainer, without the requirement.txt, it might break your application; Or
    You will spend a lot of time finding the minor issue in your maintainer. Which requirement.txt would lessen the work.
