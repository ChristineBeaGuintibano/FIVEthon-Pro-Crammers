# What is the best library to use for this project?
- Tkinter. One of the most useful library in Python.

# Why we chose Tkinter as library for this project?
- Tkinter is lightweight and relatively painless to use compared to other frameworks. 
  This makes it a compelling choice for building GUI applications in Python, 
  especially for applications where a modern sheen is unnecessary, 
  and the top priority is to quickly build something thatâ€™s functional and cross-platform.

# Why is .gitignore important? 
- The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not tracked by git remain untracked.
  Say you run git add . from the root directory of your repo, and you have nothing ignored. 
  You've just added to the index all of those files you were mentally ignoring before.
  You can create a . gitignore file in your repository's root directory to tell Git which files and directories to ignore when you make a commit. 
  To share the ignore rules with other users who clone the repository, commit the . gitignore file in to your repository.
