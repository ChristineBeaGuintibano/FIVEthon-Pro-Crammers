# Ignored files are tracked in a special file named .gitignore that is checked in at the root of your repository.     
# There is no explicit git ignore command:
# instead the .gitignore file must be edited and committed by hand when you have new files that you wish to ignore.
# .gitignore files contain patterns that are matched against file names in your repository to determine whether or not they should be ignored.

# ignores this file below
Ignore ME!
# .gitignore file hides or remove the file named "Ignore ME!" from the remote repository
